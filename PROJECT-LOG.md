# BuildMyMTB — Project Log

A dated, append-only record of what changed, **why**, and **how it was verified** — so
the project can be handed to an independent reviewer (another engineer or model) who can
trace every decision and re-check it. This is the *running* trail; its companions:

- **`FOR-REVIEWERS.md`** — the reviewer's entry point: what to read, in what order, and how
  to independently verify every claim (the four gates, provenance URLs, the "compatible =
  true" contract). _(being built)_
- **`REVIEWER-DOSSIER.md`** — the comprehensive retroactive decision + verification history.
  _(being built)_
- **Git history** — the ground truth for exact diffs; commit hashes are cited below.
- **`tools/verification-job.json`** — the per-part provenance ledger (verified vs. sample).

**Entry format:** `date` · what changed · why · how it was verified · refs (commit/branch/
issue) · what a reviewer should double-check. Newest first. The coordinator appends one entry
per wave/decision; large reconstructions are handed to a worker session.

## 2026-07-11 — Coordinator session (lean-rule correction + owner-task prep)

- **Succession housekeeping.** Archived the outgoing coordinator session ("Main Coordinator
  Old 5"). No other sessions were active.
- **Lean-coordinator rule hardened.** The coordinator seat must **never run tasks in its own
  context** (no coordinator-spawned in-session background `Agent`s — they meter against and
  bloat the seat). Task work is handed to separate worker sessions.
  - _Why:_ this session spawned an in-session background audit agent; Douglas corrected it —
    *"I don't want the coordinator sessions to run tasks. I want to keep them lean to
    coordinate."*
  - _Verified / refs:_ baked into `COORDINATOR-HANDOFF.md` §2 (removed the prior "or background
    agents" license) — commit **`2742ca8`**; and into the Claude memory topic files. The
    in-session agent was stopped and its orphan worktree pruned.
  - _Double-check:_ handoff §2 "How you work" wording.
- **Owner account tasks scoped (blocked on Douglas, by design — his accounts).**
  - _Supabase:_ base forum is already live/migrated; the pending item is the usernames/admin
    layer — run `supabase/forum-profiles.sql`, then the owner admin-grant. Security-reviewed:
    privilege escalation is prevented by a BEFORE trigger that pins `is_admin`/`verified_pro`
    off for every end-user JWT (only the service-role SQL editor can grant). Refs:
    `supabase/SETUP.md` §9, `supabase/forum-profiles.sql`.
    App code is already live and feature-detects the tables (no deploy needed to light it up).
  - _Cloudflare:_ email routing (`Doug@buildmymtb.com` → Gmail) + optional cookieless
    analytics. Runbook: `CLOUDFLARE-SETUP.md`. If analytics is enabled, the privacy page's "no
    third-party analytics" line must be reworded the same day (honesty).
  - _Connectors:_ MCP registry search returned **no** one-click Supabase or Cloudflare
    connector; manual paths remain the recommendation for these one-time tasks.
- **⚠ Stale-branch flag.** `chore/cloudflare-prep` is divergent from current `main` and would
  **revert** the forum-profiles + random-builds work. Do **not** ship it. The contact-email
  swap (`douglas.w.wills@gmail.com` → `Doug@buildmymtb.com` on privacy/terms/affiliate-
  disclosure) is to be **re-derived from current main** once Doug@ routing goes live.
- **Open item — bug #2.** GitHub issue #2 ("Wrong verdict") is still **open**, but its fix is
  already on main (`6ef9b48`; it was a stale-cache report — the catalog was already correct).
  Needs closing with a note.
- **Audit trail established.** This log started; `FOR-REVIEWERS.md` + `REVIEWER-DOSSIER.md`
  handed to a worker session to build.
- **UPDATE (later 2026-07-11) — Supabase forum-profiles migration RUN.** Douglas ran
  `supabase/forum-profiles.sql` and seeded the owner admin profile (`Doug`, `is_admin=true`).
  Forum usernames/profiles/admin-moderation/verified-pro are now LIVE (app code already deployed;
  feature-detects the tables). _Gotcha logged:_ the admin-seed UUID must be single-quoted —
  pasting it bare tripped Postgres `42601: trailing junk after numeric literal`.
  _Next:_ Cloudflare owner task still open; queued forum follow-ups (rich profiles, auto-mod)
  ready to hand off.
