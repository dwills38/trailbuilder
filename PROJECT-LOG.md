# BuildMyMTB — Project Log

A dated, append-only record of what changed, **why**, and **how it was verified** — so
the project can be handed to an independent reviewer (another engineer or model) who can
trace every decision and re-check it. This is the *running* trail; its companions:

- **`FOR-REVIEWERS.md`** — the reviewer's entry point: what to read, in what order, and how
  to independently verify every claim (the four gates, provenance URLs, the "compatible =
  true" contract). _(being built)_
- **`REVIEWER-DOSSIER.md`** — the comprehensive retroactive decision + verification history.
  _(being built)_
- **Git history** — the ground truth for exact diffs; commit hashes are cited below.
- **`tools/verification-job.json`** — the per-part provenance ledger (verified vs. sample).

**Entry format:** `date` · what changed · why · how it was verified · refs (commit/branch/
issue) · what a reviewer should double-check. Newest first. The coordinator appends one entry
per wave/decision; large reconstructions are handed to a worker session.

## 2026-07-11 — Coordinator session (lean-rule correction + owner-task prep)

- **Succession housekeeping.** Archived the outgoing coordinator session ("Main Coordinator
  Old 5"). No other sessions were active.
- **Lean-coordinator rule hardened.** The coordinator seat must **never run tasks in its own
  context** (no coordinator-spawned in-session background `Agent`s — they meter against and
  bloat the seat). Task work is handed to separate worker sessions.
  - _Why:_ this session spawned an in-session background audit agent; Douglas corrected it —
    *"I don't want the coordinator sessions to run tasks. I want to keep them lean to
    coordinate."*
  - _Verified / refs:_ baked into `COORDINATOR-HANDOFF.md` §2 (removed the prior "or background
    agents" license) — commit **`2742ca8`**; and into the Claude memory topic files. The
    in-session agent was stopped and its orphan worktree pruned.
  - _Double-check:_ handoff §2 "How you work" wording.
- **Owner account tasks scoped (blocked on Douglas, by design — his accounts).**
  - _Supabase:_ base forum is already live/migrated; the pending item is the usernames/admin
    layer — run `supabase/forum-profiles.sql`, then the owner admin-grant. Security-reviewed:
    privilege escalation is prevented by a BEFORE trigger that pins `is_admin`/`verified_pro`
    off for every end-user JWT (only the service-role SQL editor can grant). Refs:
    `supabase/SETUP.md` §9, `supabase/forum-profiles.sql`.
    App code is already live and feature-detects the tables (no deploy needed to light it up).
  - _Cloudflare:_ email routing (`Doug@buildmymtb.com` → Gmail) + optional cookieless
    analytics. Runbook: `CLOUDFLARE-SETUP.md`. If analytics is enabled, the privacy page's "no
    third-party analytics" line must be reworded the same day (honesty).
  - _Connectors:_ MCP registry search returned **no** one-click Supabase or Cloudflare
    connector; manual paths remain the recommendation for these one-time tasks.
- **⚠ Stale-branch flag.** `chore/cloudflare-prep` is divergent from current `main` and would
  **revert** the forum-profiles + random-builds work. Do **not** ship it. The contact-email
  swap (`douglas.w.wills@gmail.com` → `Doug@buildmymtb.com` on privacy/terms/affiliate-
  disclosure) is to be **re-derived from current main** once Doug@ routing goes live.
- **Open item — bug #2.** GitHub issue #2 ("Wrong verdict") is still **open**, but its fix is
  already on main (`6ef9b48`; it was a stale-cache report — the catalog was already correct).
  Needs closing with a note.
- **Audit trail established.** This log started; `FOR-REVIEWERS.md` + `REVIEWER-DOSSIER.md`
  handed to a worker session to build.
- **UPDATE (later 2026-07-11) — Supabase forum-profiles migration RUN.** Douglas ran
  `supabase/forum-profiles.sql` and seeded the owner admin profile (`Doug`, `is_admin=true`).
  Forum usernames/profiles/admin-moderation/verified-pro are now LIVE (app code already deployed;
  feature-detects the tables). _Gotcha logged:_ the admin-seed UUID must be single-quoted —
  pasting it bare tripped Postgres `42601: trailing junk after numeric literal`.
  _Next:_ Cloudflare owner task still open; queued forum follow-ups (rich profiles, auto-mod)
  ready to hand off.
- **UPDATE — reviewer audit-trail docs LANDED.** A worker session built `FOR-REVIEWERS.md`
  (entry-point/map) + `REVIEWER-DOSSIER.md` (retroactive decision + verification history, by theme,
  every claim commit-cited). Coordinator-reviewed end-to-end: accurate, honest-toned, technical-only
  (business/personal deliberately excluded — confirmed no leakage), four gates green. Merged this
  commit (only the two new files taken; the worker's branch was based on `75e0304`, one behind, so
  its stale `PROJECT-LOG.md` diff was NOT applied). The dossier honestly self-flags **13
  "reviewer should check"** items — none a live error-rule bug; the actionable follow-ups: stale
  "dead rule" wording for rules 2/8/11 (real DH-fork/FM-brake parts can now fire them) + no
  real-part error-case test for 2/11; `CLAUDE.md` roadmap/test-table prose lags shipped code;
  `MECHANIC-FINDINGS-INTAKE` rule map one behind (no rule 20). Backlogged for a doc-cleanup worker.
- **UPDATE — theme dropdown + 🍂 Loam mode SHIPPED LIVE (`6e2c202`).** Worker converted the
  Light/Dark/RAD toggles into one native `<details>` dropdown mirroring the Sample-builds menu, and
  added `html.loam` (warm forest-floor dark theme, WCAG AA verified). Scope clean (only index.html,
  126+/41−); coordinator independently re-verified gates green (validate 0 · 453 tests · tsc 0).
  ⚠ **Process note:** the worker SELF-SHIPPED to main rather than presenting a branch for Douglas's
  staged eyeball (my prompt had said "present a branch"); it claimed Douglas's launch prompt
  authorized auto-ship-if-sound. Sound + reversible, so left live — but the standing "UI stages for
  Douglas's eyeball first" rule vs. worker auto-ship is a policy question flagged to Douglas
  (unresolved at log time; do NOT bake auto-ship or a worker→coordinator auto-ping into standing
  instructions until Douglas confirms in chat — both were relayed via the worker, not from him).
- **UPDATE — forum-profile UI fix SHIPPED + hardening migration STAGED (`f689857`).** Worker fixed
  the 3 profile-UI bugs (username-as-identity header button; `[object PointerEvent]` guard; header
  auto re-render) + authored `supabase/forum-profiles-hardening.sql` (search_path pins on the 4
  flagged functions + least-privilege EXECUTE on `username_is_reserved`). Cherry-picked onto current
  main (branch was based on `f20c6bf`; a naive merge would have reverted theme/Loam + the reviewer
  docs). UI auto-shipped on green gates (new policy); the `.sql` is inert in-repo — **Douglas runs it
  in Supabase** (security tier). Coordinator independently reviewed the migration: bodies byte-
  identical, `profile_norm` stays IMMUTABLE, REVOKE-from-public can't strip authenticated's direct
  grant, fails CLOSED — escalation still impossible, reserved-names still fire. CONFIRMED SAFE
  (agrees with the worker's in-session auditor). Four gates green.
- **UPDATE — doc-cleanup LANDED (`73a3420`).** Chip refreshed 4 stale docs (CLAUDE.md,
  EXPERT-REVIEW-DOSSIER.md, REVIEW.md, MECHANIC-FINDINGS-INTAKE.md): rules 2/8/11 de-staled
  (rule 8-front + rule 11 now fully live WITH real-part error tests; rule 2-front has live vocab but
  its error case is still synthetic-only), CLAUDE.md roadmap + test-table + rules 10b/14c corrected,
  mechanic-intake rule map extended to rule 20. It independently verified all 12 DATA-MODEL-REVIEW
  §8 catalog items — **10 landed, 1 moot, 1 deliberate; NO un-applied catalog error remains.**
  Docs-only, four gates green, self-merged. Coordinator caught the original brief was wrong (rule 11
  already had a real-part error test — only rule 2-front lacks one). **OPEN (Douglas's call):** add a
  real-part error-case test for rule 2-front? A dual-crown DH fork on a trail wheel is nonsensical —
  coordinator recommends LEAVING it (a contrived test is worse than none).
